# Grocery Store Simulation - TTM4110 Dependability and Performance with Discrete Event Simulation, Course Project

This repository was created to collaborate with my teammate on the code for the final lab project during the TTM4110 "Dependability and Performance with Discrete Event Simulation" course at NTNU. 
In this course, we had three labs focusing on different parts of simulating a system, as well as this final project where we got to combine the knowledge from previous labs to create a complete event simulation. 

The project task was to create a simulation of a grocery store environment. This environment included customers and employees in the grocery store, performing different tasks. 
Customers arrive at the store with a Poisson distribution, visit sections that contain the items on their shopping list, and check out. If the sections or the queue is full, the customers will wait in queue. 
Employees go around the store, restocking empty sections and repairing failed counters. 

The goal of the project was to see the effect of a different number of employees on the queue time and availability of the checkout counters. 
My teammate on this project was @elinehso. We received an A in the course for this project. 

**Topics covered:**
- Reliability, availability, and system time
- Markov models for systems
- Erlang and Engset blocking models
- Basics on stochastic processes
- DEMOS/SIMULA
- Output analysis
